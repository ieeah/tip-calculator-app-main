# Frontend Mentor - Tip calculator app

## I struggled a lot more of what I expected

First of all I think I should split in two parts this challenge.
- The Layout.
- The Logic.

#### The Layout
I didn't struggled that much with this, I know it isn't "pixel perfect", but I think makes actually no sense talking about "pixel perfect layouts" in this age in which a layout has to adapt to thousands of different screens.

#### The Logic
This made me sweat a lot more of what i thought.
I've been trying for a while using Vanilla Javascript, to challenge myself (actually I do have to study and practice a lot more on our dear old Js) and because I thought it wasn't going to be that hard.
The biggest problem is the fact that Vanilla Js totally lacks in reactivity, so was really hard (for me) to make the display always being updated every time one of the three parameters was changing; For this reason, at the end I decided to use the CDN version of Vue.Js, which whit his "computed methods" gave me a lot of reactivity and made me go pretty fast in the coding.

## Responsiveness
I'm not really happy with the mobile version, I think it's ok, but not really close to the given design.
